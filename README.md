# Low-Drop-Out-Regulator-Design

Basically, low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are linear voltage regulators that maintain stable output voltage even when supply voltage is close to output voltage. They offer advantages of low noise, high ripple rejection, and efficiency optimization, making them ideal for diverse applications like mobile phones and laptops. Key performance parameters include dropout voltage, quiescent current, load and line regulation, output voltage accuracy, PSRR, transient response, and efficiency. Overall, LDOs ensure clean and reliable power supply in electronic devices with varying input voltages. An LDO voltage regulator typically consists of a reference voltage, a mechanism of scaling the output voltage and comparing it to the reference, a feedback amplifier, and a series pass transistor (bipolar or FET), whose voltage drop is controlled by the amplifier to maintain the output at the required value. Our task was to design a Low Drop Out Regulator with some given specifications. The primary hurdle encountered during the project revolved around fine-tuning the parameters to achieve the desired specifications. Notably, there were considerable trade-offs among these specifications. We used Cadence Virtuoso to design the LDO. We have used the library gpdk045 along with other basic libraries to complete our project. The rest schematic components such as Vdc, Idc, Gnd were imported from Cadence native Analog lib library. Fortunately, we have been able to fulfill all of the requirements successfully. Moreover, we have tried the layout design. But due to size limitations of our library, layout could not be finished properly. By using the accurate gpdk library, I think layout design would be accomplished, DRC and LVS as well.
